# leagueAI
League AI is an application that predicts the winner of a league of legends game live. The application uses the live client data API to collect game data on a local machine such as kills, towers destroyed, dragon kills, and more. This data is fed into a neural network trained using 10000 challenger games from NA, EUW, and KR servers to identify trends and patterns that will predict which team wins. The program is written in Python using tensorflow keras and the lolwatcher API wrapper.
